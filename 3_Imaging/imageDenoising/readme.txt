Sample: Image denoising
Minimum spec: GeForce 8

 This sample demonstrates two adaptive image denoising technqiues: KNN and NLM, based on computation of both geometric and color distance between texels. While both techniques are implemented in the DirectX SDK using shaders, massively speeded up variation of the latter techique, taking advantage of shared memory, is implemented in addition to DirectX counterparts.
